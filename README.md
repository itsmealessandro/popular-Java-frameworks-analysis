# Web App Frameworks Comparison

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop the same web application multiple times, each using a different framework or architecture. By doing so, we aim to explore how different technologies approach the same problem and to analyze their respective strengths and weaknesses.

## Frameworks and Architectures Used

- **Spring Boot**: A mature and comprehensive framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.
- **Micronaut**: A modern, JVM-based full-stack framework designed for building lightweight, fast applications.
- **Quarkus**: A Kubernetes-native Java framework optimized for memory usage and fast startup times.
- **Others**: Additional frameworks or technologies may be added as the project evolves.

## Performance Comparison

One of the key aspects of this project is to compare the performance of the different implementations. We will measure and compare the following metrics:

- **Startup Time**: How long it takes for the application to become ready after being launched.
- **Memory Usage**: The amount of memory consumed by the application under similar loads.
- **Response Time**: How quickly the application responds to user requests.
- **Throughput**: The number of requests the application can handle per second under load.
- **Scalability**: How well the application performs as the number of users or data grows.

## Structure

Each directory within this repository contains:

- The complete source code for the application using a specific framework.
- A `README.md` detailing how to set up and run the application.
- Benchmarking scripts and results for performance comparison.
